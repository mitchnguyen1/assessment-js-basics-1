const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysis = `This is the second step, this is determining what does the user, client, or stakeholder wants. Determine what is the requirement to meet the end goal.`
const design = `This is the third step, where the team draw and map according to the requirements. UX/UI team will create a wireframe/blueprint of the project.`
const implementation = `This is the fourth step, where we build and develop the project. When the team actually code and create features. `
const testing = `This is the fifth step, the QA team will test the project for any bugs. This step is where web scrapers are used, testing units are made for backend, and ensuring CRUD api works.`
const maintain = `The sixth step, or final step, consist of DevOps team deciding the best place to deploy the project. From choosing a cloud server to a database. This step also checks for any future or unexpected bugs. Also to ensure that the project is constantly running and working.`
